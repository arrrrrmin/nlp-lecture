Lecture notes and examples for nlp-lecture at HSRT (Reutlingen University)


Do yourself a favour and install [pdm](https://pdm-project.org/latest/#recommended-installation-method). 
This allows you to install all dependencies in a managed virtual env. Run `pdm install` for installation. 
This repo runs on `python3.11.*`. Make sure you got any version `3.11.*` installed.

If everything is fine run `pdm run jupyter lab`. Enjoy :tada:
